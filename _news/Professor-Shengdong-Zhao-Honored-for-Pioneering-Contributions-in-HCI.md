Additionally, his groundbreaking project, **GestureGPT: Toward Zero-Shot Free-Form Hand Gesture Understanding with Large Language Model Agents**, developed in collaboration with Zhang Tengxianâ€™s team, has been featured in the [SCM Research Stories](https://www.scm.cityu.edu.hk/research/gesturegpt-transforming-gesture-recognition-and-human-computer-interaction) section. This project addresses a fundamental challenge in gesture recognition and has earned the Best Paper Award at ACM ISS 2024. GestureGPT combines contextual inference with interaction data to infer user intent, making gesture-based interfaces seamless and adaptive.

Congratulations to Professor Zhao on these well-deserved honors!

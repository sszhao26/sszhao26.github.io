 heading: "Our Vision: Heads-Up Computing"

 content: we have an ambitious vision to fundamentally change the way we interact with technology through Heads-Up Computing - the next interaction paradigm, built on a wearable platform consisting of head, hand, and body modules that distributes the input and output capabilities of the device to match the human input and output channels. Heads-Up proposes a voice + gesture multimodal interaction approach, which once realized, can significantly change the way we work and live - imagine being able to attend to and manipulate information seamlessly while engaging in a variety of indoor and outdoor daily activities such as cooking, exercising, hiking, socializing with friends, etc.

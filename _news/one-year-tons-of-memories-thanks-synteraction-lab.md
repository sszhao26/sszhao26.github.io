>Hi, I'm Yuxuan, a 4th-year Ph.D. candidate in Design Informatics at WUT. I joined the Synteraction Lab from June 2024 to June 2025 as a visiting Ph.D. student. This year of visiting has been incredibly rewarding - working alongside passionate HCI researchers has not only fueled my growth but also elevated my research skills. From lab meetings to workouts to dinners - all these wonderful moments add up to one heartfelt farewell. See you all in the next chapter!

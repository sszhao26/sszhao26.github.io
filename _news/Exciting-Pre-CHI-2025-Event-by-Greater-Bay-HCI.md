We are thrilled to announce that the Greater Bay Area Human-Computer Interaction (GBA HCI) community is hosting a Pre-CHI 2025 event on April 12th, 2025, at the City University of Hong Kong. This one-day, on-site event promises to be a vibrant platform for HCI researchers from the Greater Bay Area to share their latest work and foster academic collaboration.

The Pre-CHI 2025 event aims to provide a dedicated space for researchers to present their work, whether it is set to be published at ACM CHI 2025 or other premier HCI venues. The event will feature a mix of presentations and poster sessions, showcasing both completed research and ongoing exploratory projects. This is an excellent opportunity for researchers to receive feedback and engage in meaningful discussions with peers.

The event will kick off with a welcome reception at 9:00 AM, followed by an opening keynote by Prof. Xiaohua Sun from the Southern University of Science and Technology. The day will be packed with insightful sessions covering various HCI topics, including GenAI in everyday life, technology-enhanced learning, interactive systems and data visualization, collaborative and creative research methodologies, human-centered healthcare, and interaction in VR/AR.

Participants will also have the chance to network during the lunch break and tea break, which will include poster sessions and group photo opportunities. The event will conclude with a closing keynote by Prof. Haining Liang from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), followed by an award ceremony.

We encourage all HCI researchers from the Greater Bay Area to register and participate in this enriching event. Whether you are presenting your work or attending as an audience member, Pre-CHI 2025 is an excellent opportunity to connect with fellow researchers and stay updated on the latest advancements in the field of HCI.

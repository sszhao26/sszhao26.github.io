## Abstract

Advanced wearable digital assistants can significantly enhance task performance, reduce user burden, and provide personalized guidance to improve users' abilities. However, developing these assistants presents several challenges. To address this, we introduce TOM (The Other Me), a conceptual architecture and open-source software platform [https://github.com/TOM-Platform](https://github.com/TOM-Platform) that supports the development of wearable intelligent assistants that are contextually aware of both the user and the environment. Collaboratively developed with researchers and developers, TOM meets their diverse requirements. TOM facilitates the creation of intelligent assistive AR applications for daily activities, supports the recording and analysis of user interactions, and provides assistance for various activities, as demonstrated in our preliminary evaluations.

Professor Shengdong (Shen) Zhao hosted a dinner in Hong Kong with friends, academic colleagues, and lab members during **SIGGRAPH Asia 2025**. The gathering provided a relaxed space to unwind, reconnect, and enjoy conversations beyond the conference environment.

The dinner was joined by Dr. Neng-Hao (Jones) Yu, Associate Professor in the Department of Design at the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology; Professor Mark Billinghurst, Professor of Human–Computer Interaction at the University of South Australia; and Dr. Jeannie Lee, Deputy Director of the Centre for Immersification and Associate Professor. Members of Prof. Zhao’s lab also took part in the evening.

Everyone enjoyed traditional Hong Kong dishes while chatting about research, teaching, and shared experiences, as well as everyday life. The informal atmosphere made it easy for colleagues and students to connect across institutions and career stages.

The evening ended on a warm note, reflecting the value of shared meals in strengthening academic communities and long-standing collaborations.

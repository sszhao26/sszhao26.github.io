Join us at Ubicomp 2024 for an immersive workshop on Heads-Up Computing, where we'll navigate the future of wearable and pervasive technology — all innovators and thought leaders are welcome!

The UbiComp/ISWC 2024 workshop will focus on "Heads-Up Computing," exploring the future of wearable intelligent assistants like Apple's Vision Pro, Rayban Meta Glasses, and XReal’s Air smartglasses. This event will address design challenges, user interaction, privacy, and ethics in integrating these devices into daily life. 

The workshop invites academics and industry professionals to submit papers by July 5, 2024, with the event scheduled for October 5-6 in Melbourne, Australia.

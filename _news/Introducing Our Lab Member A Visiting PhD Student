We are excited to introduce to you Yuxuan Li, who has recently joined our lab! Get to know him more:

> I am Yuxuan Li, a Ph.D. candidate in Design Informatics,Wuhan University of Technology. My research interest is cognitive load and quantitative assessment in multi-modal interaction behavior. Currently focusing on the healthcare field such as surgical navigation and remote control, developing artifacts in combination with artificial intelligence, passive brain-computer interfaces, and spatial computing technologies. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I co-founded a startup company with my friends, where we designed automated nucleic acid testing sites across Wuhan. This experience made me deeply aware of the importance of intelligent and user-centric design. In my free time, I enjoy drinking tea and chatting with friends. Additionally, I have a very needy cat named "Paper".

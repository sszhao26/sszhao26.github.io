On Friday, June 6, 2025, members of the Kowloon Interaction Center (KLIC) held a session focused on the topic of “Best Practice in Supervision.” The session was based on a workshop recently attended by one of the members, organized by Imperial College London.

The discussion centered around approaches to supervising students, with an emphasis on reflecting on current practices and hearing diverse perspectives. In preparation for the session, participants were invited to share their thoughts anonymously through a survey, helping to create a more open and comfortable environment for discussion.

The topic was relevant to both current supervisors and students who may take on supervisory roles in the future. By drawing from external insights and internal reflections, the session encouraged thoughtful dialogue within the group.

KLIC thanks everyone who took part in the session and contributed to the conversation.

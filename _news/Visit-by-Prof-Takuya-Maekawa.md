The lab had the privilege of hosting Prof. Takuya Maekawa at the Smart Systems Institute, National University of Singapore. He shared his inspiring cross-disciplinary work on "Intelligent Animal-Borne Sensor Systems for Animal Behavioral Research."

It was fascinating to learn how his expertise in sensing and human behavior observation is being applied to uncover "unknown" animal behaviors. His collaborative efforts with biologists to tackle global challenges and create a meaningful impact were particularly impressive.

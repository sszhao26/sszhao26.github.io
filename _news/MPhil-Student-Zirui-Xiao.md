Meet our new MPhil student, Zirui Xiao!

> Hi! I'm Zirui Xiao, currently pursuing an MPhil degree in Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong. My research interests lie at the intersection of software engineering, extended reality (XR) systems, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I'm particularly focused on developing large-scale mixed reality systems for remote collaboration and creating reliable objective data metrics by combining spatial data with biological signals.

Prior to joining the Synteraction Lab, I gained valuable experience at the Empathic Computing Lab (ECL), where I worked on projects like FusionNexus and investigated input methods in AR, VR, and MR. My expertise extends to software engineering, network engineering, and XR development.

In my free time, I enjoy music production, particularly in EDM and Pop genres, and playing keyboard and electric guitar. I'm passionate about interdisciplinary approaches and exploring how technology can intersect with other fields to create innovative solutions.

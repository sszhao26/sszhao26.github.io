title: "How to Join Synteraction Lab"

description: Joining a top-tier research lab like Synteraction Lab, in the dynamic field of human-computer interaction (HCI) research, can be a complex process. We are committed to nurturing new talent and developing the next generation of leading researchers. Due to our limited resources, we have implemented a rigorous selection process to ensure that only the most promising candidates join our team. This guide outlines our approach for integrating new PhD and Master’s students.

  title: Understanding the Investment
  sub: At Synteraction Lab, we consider each graduate student a significant investment in various crucial aspects.
  list:
   - Time Investment - Master’s students typically spend at least two years with us, while PhD students may be part of the lab for four to five years. During this time, students engage extensively with supervisors and peers, participating in a range of training and practice activities. We provide daily feedback to foster learning and growth, representing a considerable investment of time and effort from our team.
   - Financial Investment - Supporting our students also involves a substantial financial commitment. For instance, the funding for a PhD scholarship can reach up to 800,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong and nearly 2 million HK dollars at NUS Singapore (Roughly half of this amount goes to the tuition and other fees, while the other half goes to the scholarship).
   - Emotional Investment - Beyond time and money, we invest emotionally as well. Each lab member is regarded as part of our extended family, which underscores the depth of our commitment to their success and well-being.
  note: Given these investments, it is crucial that they translate into the development of exceptional researchers. Premature departures or less-than-satisfactory research outcomes can lead to significant losses—not just in financial terms, but also in time and effort. This underscores why we are so selective in our admissions process, aiming to ensure that every student has the potential to excel and contribute positively to our lab community.

  title: The Challenge of Assessing Potential
  sub: Eligibility
  list:
   - Must be in Hong Kong, and not remote
   - Willing to commit full-time for at least 4 months
   - Currently undergraduate or has recently graduated with a bachelor
  note: Evaluating a prospective student's potential is a complex task. Traditional tools such as CVs, portfolios, and interviews often do not fully capture a candidate's true capabilities. Successful researchers excel beyond their technical skills; they are adept in time management, display resilience, and possess robust social skills—all critical for thriving in a research environment. Furthermore, even glowing recommendation letters might not always provide a complete picture unless they are from reliable sources within our established network. This highlights the challenge of identifying truly promising candidates who can meet the high standards of our lab. Thus, our selection process is designed to assess these diverse competencies to ensure we choose individuals who can significantly contribute to and benefit from our research community.

  title: The Preferred Pathway
  deliverables: To enhance our candidate selection process and better assess skills, we recommend participating in our annual HCI research workshop in Chiang Mai. This event is structured to not only introduce participants to the fundamentals of HCI research but also to engage them in a stimulating and supportive setting. For those who might not be able to attend the workshop, we offer an alternative option of a research attachment. Details of this opportunity are provided below, ensuring that all interested candidates have a pathway to engage with our team and demonstrate their capabilities.

   - Indicate your interest in joining the workshop by emailing us or by filling out the online application form when it becomes available.
   - Begin your preparation by reading the recommended materials for first-year PhD students, which will be provided upon your expression of interest.

  step2:
   - Schedule - The workshop is held annually in early July and lasts for 10 days. It begins with five days of seminars focused on the fundamentals of HCI research, followed by a five-day intensive "paperthon" where you will start developing a research project.
   - Post-Workshop Development - After the initial 10 days, you can spend an additional 20 days in Chiang Mai. During this period, you will receive daily guidance to further advance your project. After the immersive experience, you have the opportunity to continue collaborating with our lab remotely to finalize your paper. This ongoing partnership enables you to further refine your research and prepare for submission to prestigious HCI conferences such as CHI or UbiComp, enhancing the impact and reach of your work.

  step3:
   - While we strongly encourage participation in the Chiang Mai Research Workshop, we understand that it may not be feasible for everyone. If you are unable to attend the workshop, we invite you to explore our research attachment options. You can submit a research proposal and initiate a project under the guidance of lab members and the professor. This opportunity allows you to develop your research further and aim for a submission to a top HCI venue. Please feel free to contact us for more details on how to proceed.

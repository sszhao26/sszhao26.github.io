 At the recent Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge (Hong Kong Section) Half Marathon 2024/25, Rui Yao from Synteraction Lab achieved a new personal best (PB) of 01:55:01. Recognized as a World Athletics Gold Label Road Race, the event is renowned for its challenging course, which includes over 170 meters of cumulative elevation gain.

Rui attributes this success to the supportive culture at Synteraction Lab, where weekly runs at the joint sports center foster camaraderie, enjoyment, and personal growth. He also credits Prof. Shenâ€™s expert guidance, which focuses on improvement while preventing injuries. Rui hopes more peers will join this exciting activity in the future, forming a running club at Synteraction Lab and allowing everyone to reap the long-lasting benefits of running.

Say Hello to Our New Research Assistant, Sam Wang!

> Hi, Iâ€™m Sam Wang (Hsin-Yi Wang).

> I am a senior computer science student at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, with a strong interest in virtual and augmented reality, ubiquitous computing, speculative design, and new media art. My previous work includes several collaborative projects with designers and artists, where I integrated design and art concepts with virtual reality. Additionally, I conducted research exploring the relationship between motion sickness and VR/AR devices. These experiences have fostered a deep passion for the intersection of design, art, and technology.

> Currently, my research focuses on enhancing human communication through VR/AR technologies, aiming to improve communication efficiency. Before pursuing my master's degree, I will join Synteraction Lab as a research assistant.

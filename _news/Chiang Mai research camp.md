Synteraction Lab invites you to a summer Research Camp in the second week of July in Chiang Mai, Thailand. This stunning city, steeped in history and rich in culture, provides an inspiring backdrop to delve into the exciting world of HCI research.

The six-day intensive training course (July 6-13, 2024) offers more than just academic enrichment. Shine during the camp, selected participants could join a research internship project, potentially earning a co-author credit in a publication for the prestigious ACM SIGCHI conference. As part of the internship, these participants will also receive three weeks of free accommodation, allowing them to fully immerse themselves in Chiang Mai's tranquil atmosphere and vibrant culture.
This is a unique opportunity to enhance your research skills, collaborate with experienced researchers, and potentially kick-start your publication journey in HCI. All set against the backdrop of Chiang Mai, a city known for its breathtaking landscapes, historic temples, and friendly locals.

We are delighted to welcome **Dr. CHEN Yang (Sonne)**, who has joined the **Synteraction Lab at City University of Hong Kong** as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. Prior to this appointment, she was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the **Keio-NUS CUTE Center, National University of Singapore.**

Sonne recently completed her **PhD in Industrial Design (Human–Computer Interaction) at NUS**, where she investigated how interactive systems can influence everyday behaviors and enhance well-being. At CityU, her research will continue to focus on **designing technologies that evolve with users** — from playful tangible interfaces to AI-driven systems that foster **healthier habits, creativity, and learning.**

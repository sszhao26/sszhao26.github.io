We have a new research intern from Tsinghua University, Zhian. Get to know him:

> Hello everyone! I'm Hu Zhian, currently a senior student majoring in architecture at Tsinghua University. In my previous design experiements, I paid special attention to what kind of architectural space can bring the greatest comfort to the user's perception. This led me to change my academic trajectory and began to try to use computer technology to study and optimize user behavior. Therefore, joining Synteraction lab is a new start of my academic career, and I hope to have more communications with our group members and to make some contribution to the research team.

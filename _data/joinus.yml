  title: Understanding the Investment
  sub: At Synteraction Lab, we consider each graduate student a significant investment in various crucial aspects.
  list:
   - Time Investment - Master’s students typically spend at least two years with us, while PhD students may be part of the lab for four to five years. During this time, students engage extensively with supervisors and peers, participating in a range of training and practice activities. We provide daily feedback to foster learning and growth, representing a considerable investment of time and effort from our team.
   - Financial Investment - Supporting our students also involves a substantial financial commitment. For instance, the funding for a PhD scholarship can reach up to 800,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong and nearly 2 million HK dollars at NUS Singapore (Roughly half of this amount goes to the tuition and other fees, while the other half goes to the scholarship).
   - Emotional Investment - Beyond time and money, we invest emotionally as well. Each lab member is regarded as part of our extended family, which underscores the depth of our commitment to their success and well-being.
  note: Given these investments, it is crucial that they translate into the development of exceptional researchers. Premature departures or less-than-satisfactory research outcomes can lead to significant losses—not just in financial terms, but also in time and effort. This underscores why we are so selective in our admissions process, aiming to ensure that every student has the potential to excel and contribute positively to our lab community.

  title: The Challenge of Assessing Potential
  sub: Eligibility
  list:
   - Must be in Hong Kong, and not remote
   - Willing to commit full-time for at least 4 months
   - Currently undergraduate or has recently graduated with a bachelor
  note: Evaluating a prospective student's potential is a complex task. Traditional tools such as CVs, portfolios, and interviews often do not fully capture a candidate's true capabilities. Successful researchers excel beyond their technical skills; they are adept in time management, display resilience, and possess robust social skills—all critical for thriving in a research environment. Furthermore, even glowing recommendation letters might not always provide a complete picture unless they are from reliable sources within our established network. This highlights the challenge of identifying truly promising candidates who can meet the high standards of our lab. Thus, our selection process is designed to assess these diverse competencies to ensure we choose individuals who can significantly contribute to and benefit from our research community.

  title: The Preferred Pathway
  deliverables: To enhance our candidate selection process and better assess skills, we recommend participating in our annual HCI research workshop in Chiang Mai. This event is structured to not only introduce participants to the fundamentals of HCI research but also to engage them in a stimulating and supportive setting. For those who might not be able to attend the workshop, we offer an alternative option of a research attachment. Details of this opportunity are provided below, ensuring that all interested candidates have a pathway to engage with our team and demonstrate their capabilities.
